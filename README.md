# Dependencies

This project relies on various Node.js packages (dependencies) to provide essential functionality. Below is a list of these dependencies along with a brief description of their purpose:

@sendgrid/mail: A Node.js library for sending emails using the SendGrid email delivery service. It's commonly used for transactional emails, notifications, and marketing emails.

body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a Node.js application. It supports parsing JSON, URL-encoded, and other types of request bodies.

braintree: A library for integrating the Braintree payment gateway into a Node.js application. It enables processing of various payment methods like credit cards, PayPal, etc.

cookie-parser: Middleware for parsing cookie headers in HTTP requests. It simplifies handling of cookies in a Node.js application.

cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in a Node.js application. It allows controlling access to resources from different origins.

dotenv: A module for loading environment variables from a .env file into Node.js' process.env. It's commonly used for storing configuration settings like API keys, database connection strings, etc.

express: The de facto web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support, and HTTP utilities.

express-jwt: Middleware for verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a Node.js application. It's commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes.

express-validator: A set of express.js middleware for input validation and sanitization. It's commonly used for validating and sanitizing user input in web applications.

formidable: A Node.js module for parsing form data, especially file uploads. It simplifies handling of file uploads in HTTP requests.

jsonwebtoken: A library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Node.js. It's commonly used for implementing stateless authentication mechanisms.

lodash: A utility library that provides helper functions for common programming tasks such as manipulating arrays, objects, strings, etc.

mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model application data and simplifies interactions with MongoDB databases.

morgan: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It simplifies logging of HTTP requests in a Node.js application.

node: The Node.js runtime itself. This dependency seems unnecessary as specifying a version in the dependencies section of package.json is not required for the Node.js runtime.

nodemon: A utility that monitors changes in a Node.js application and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected. It's commonly used during development to speed up the development process.

uuid: A library for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) in Node.js. It's commonly used for generating unique identifiers for resources in distributed systems.

These dependencies cover a wide range of functionalities commonly needed in Node.js web development. Depending on your specific project requirements, you may or may not need all of them. Make sure to install only the dependencies that are necessary for your application.

etc. (list any other major technologies or libraries used)
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:



bash
Copy code
cd yourproject
npm install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=8000
DATABASE=your_mongodb_connection_string
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID=your_braintree_merchant_id
BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_braintree_public_key
BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_braintree_private_key
Replace your_mongodb_connection_string, your_sendgrid_api_key, your_braintree_merchant_id, your_braintree_public_key, and your_braintree_private_key with your actual values.

Run the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:8000.

Structure
/routes: Contains route handlers for different endpoints.
/models: Contains Mongoose models for interacting with the MongoDB database.
/middlewares: Contains custom middleware functions.
/public: Contains static files (if any).
/views: Contains view files (if using a templating engine like EJS).
Features
Authentication: Implement authentication using JWT tokens.
CRUD Operations: Perform CRUD operations on various resources like users, categories, products, etc.
Email Functionality: Send emails for various notifications using the SendGrid API.
